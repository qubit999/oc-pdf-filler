name: pdf-filler
description: Extract and fill PDF AcroForm fields with a multi-backend fallback chain. Reads field schemas (text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, multi-line text) from any AcroForm PDF and fills them using user-provided JSON values. Tries pypdf, pdfrw, PyMuPDF, and pdftk in order so it works on PDFs that defeat any single library. Use when the user wants to inspect, populate, batch-fill, or programmatically complete PDF forms, or asks about extracting form field names from a PDF, filling out a PDF, generating a filled PDF, or AcroForm processing.
license: MIT
compatibility: Requires Python 3.10+ on the agent host. Optional system dependency `pdftk` enables a last-resort backend; optional Python packages `pdfrw` and `PyMuPDF` expand the fallback chain.

# pdf-filler

Operate on PDF AcroForms: list every field with its type and current value, then fill the PDF with values supplied as JSON. The skill calls a small Python package (`oc-pdf-filler`) that wraps a fallback chain of PDF libraries, so a single recalcitrant PDF doesn't block the workflow.

## Workspace rules (read this first)

Many agent hosts run inside a sandbox that only allows reads/writes inside a
specific workspace folder. Files written outside that folder show up as
"Unavailable / Outside allowed folders" and the user can't download them.

The CLI enforces this for you:

- The "workspace" is resolved from the first set environment variable in this list,
  falling back to the current working directory:
  `OC_PDF_FILLER_WORKSPACE`, `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE`, `CLAWHUB_WORKSPACE`,
  `AGENT_WORKSPACE`, `SKILL_WORKSPACE`, `WORKSPACE`.
- All output paths (schema JSON and filled PDF) are resolved **relative to the workspace**.
- If you pass an absolute `--output` that points outside the workspace, the CLI
  rewrites it to the same basename inside the workspace (and prints a warning to
  stderr).
- You can override the workspace explicitly with `--workspace DIR`.

In practice: pass relative paths (e.g. `-o form_done.pdf`), or omit `--output`
entirely. The default is `<input-stem>_done.pdf` inside the workspace.

## When to use

Trigger this skill when the user:

- Asks to inspect, list, or extract the form fields of a PDF
- Wants to fill out / populate / complete a PDF form programmatically
- Mentions AcroForm, checkbox, radio button, or dropdown handling in a PDF
- Has a batch of PDFs to fill from structured data (JSON)

## Setup (once per workspace)

The skill scripts call the `oc-pdf-filler` Python package. Install it first:

```bash
pip install "oc-pdf-filler[all]"
# or, if working from the source repo: pip install -e ".[all]"
```

The `[all]` extra pulls in `pdfrw` and `PyMuPDF` for the full fallback chain. Install `pdftk` from your package manager for the last-resort backend (optional, but useful for stubborn PDFs).

Verify which backends are active:

```bash
python scripts/list_backends.py
```

## Step 1: Extract the field schema

Always extract first so you know the exact field names and types before constructing the JSON values file. Use a workspace-relative path for the output (the CLI confines it to the workspace automatically).

```bash
python scripts/extract.py /path/to/form.pdf --output schema.json --include-values
```

Each entry in the resulting JSON has:

- `name`: the AcroForm field name (use this verbatim as the key when filling)
- `type`: one of `text`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `choice`, `signature`, `pushbutton`, `unknown`
- `options`: for radios and checkboxes, the accepted export values; for choices, the dropdown options
- `value`: current value if the form is partially filled (only when `--include-values` is set)
- `max_length`, `multiline`, `required`, `read_only`: hints for validation

See `references/FIELD_TYPES.md` for the value contract per field type.

## Step 2: Build a values JSON file

The fill input is a flat JSON object `{ "FieldName": value }`. Example:

```json
{
  "Name Verantwortlicher": "ACME GmbH",
  "Postleitzahl Verantwortlicher": "10115",
  "Beschäftigte": true,
  "Verarbeitungstyp": "Automatisiert"
}
```

A starter template is included at `assets/values.example.json`.

## Step 3: Fill the PDF

Omit `--output` to get the recommended default `<input-stem>_done.pdf` inside the workspace, or pass a workspace-relative filename. Absolute paths outside the workspace are automatically rewritten into it (the host's sandbox would reject them otherwise).

```bash
# preferred: keep the original name with _done suffix, in the workspace
python scripts/fill.py /path/to/form.pdf values.json
# or pass an explicit relative path
python scripts/fill.py /path/to/form.pdf values.json --output form_done.pdf
```

By default the orchestrator uses `--backend auto`, walking the chain `pypdf -> pdfrw -> PyMuPDF -> pdftk` and stopping at the first backend that fills every field.

Useful flags:

- `--backend pymupdf` -- force a specific backend (e.g. when the auto winner produces a PDF that doesn't render correctly in your viewer)
- `--best-effort` -- chain backends so partial fills accumulate (use when no single backend handles every field)
- `--flatten` -- bake values into the PDF so they can't be edited (best support: PyMuPDF, pdftk)
- `--strict` -- exit non-zero if any requested field is missing or unfillable

The script prints a JSON summary including `winning_backend`, `workspace`, `output_path` (absolute path of the resulting PDF, always inside the workspace), `filled`, `missing`, `failed`, and per-attempt details. If filling fails, see `references/BACKENDS.md` for backend-specific troubleshooting tips.

## Delivering the result to the user

After a successful fill, the user expects to receive the PDF as an attachment. To make that work reliably across hosts:

1. Read `output_path` from the fill summary. It is guaranteed to be inside the workspace, so the host can attach it.
2. Surface that path in your final message and use whatever attachment / file-return mechanism the host provides so the PDF arrives as a downloadable attachment.
3. Never write the PDF outside the workspace (e.g. `/tmp`, `/var`, your home directory). Sandboxed hosts will mark it as "Unavailable / Outside allowed folders".

## End-to-end example

```bash
python scripts/extract.py form.pdf -o schema.json
# ... agent inspects schema.json, builds values.json based on user input ...
python scripts/fill.py form.pdf values.json
# writes <workspace>/form_done.pdf
```

After filling, re-run `extract.py --include-values form_done.pdf` and confirm the values stuck before delivering the PDF to the user.

## Notes and edge cases

- Field names may contain spaces, German umlauts, or punctuation. Always copy them verbatim from `extract.py` output.
- For radio groups, set the value to the export name of the chosen option (one of the strings in `options`), not a boolean.
- Signature fields (`type: signature`) are reported but not auto-filled.
- Encrypted PDFs are out of scope; the tool will surface the underlying library error.
- Some PDF viewers cache appearance streams; if a viewer shows blank fields after filling, try opening with a different viewer or use `--flatten`.
